data model restructuring => performance drops
data model defined at the application level (what data application needs and application's read/write usage)

step by step iteration:
- evaluate the application workload
- map out entities and their relationships
	- to link or to embed?
		- one to one, many to one, many to many
		- see if the data uses embedded information a lot
- finalize the data model for each collection
	- identify and apply relevant design patterns
