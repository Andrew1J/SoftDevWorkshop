K12 -- Rendering Templates
2021-10-07

Expected Behaviors:
Q0: What happens if you remove render_template from this line?
It says render_template is not defined because you call render_template in the
test_templt() function, but that function is not defined.

Q1: Can all of your teammates confidently predict the URL to use to load this page?
http://127.0.0.1:5000/my_foist_template. @app.route() specifies the route as
/my_foist_template

Q2: What is the significance of each argument?
render_template goes to the file 'model_tmplt.html' and renders it. The foo argument
replaces the foo title in the html file with the value provided. The collection argument
accepts the coll defined in app.py and displays each item [0,1,2...]

Results:
It works as expected. render_template renders the model_tmplt.html file in templates folder.
