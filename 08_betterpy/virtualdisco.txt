Investigating: $ python3 -m venv ~/myherozero

python3 - calls the appropriate version of python (opposed to python2)

-m - calls the program to access main

venv - stands for virtual environment and is used to install Python packages for
       different projects without installing the packages globally. The installation
       of python packages is isolated so they possibly don't conflict with other
       packages in other projects.

~/myherozero - "~/" specifies the home directory of your project "myherozero"
